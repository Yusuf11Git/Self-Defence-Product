        Top-of-the-line home defense: The T4E HDR 50 Home Defence Revolver is a revolver with visible strengths â€“ large caliber (.50) enormous muzzle energy and an imposing appearance.
        The easy-to-load rotary magazine holds six .50-caliber projectiles that are fired at up to 11 joules.
        Power is supplied by a CO2 cartridge located in the grip. A light blow at the bottom suffices to pierce it. Thus the Home Defense Revolver 50 is ready to use at any time and has full cartridges when you need them.
        The textured frame surfaces give you a secure grip even in stress situations, and a trigger blade safety prevents accidental firing if you should ever drop the gun.
        T4E HDR 50 Home Defence Revolver is powered by a CO2 capsule, which is easily accessible in the magazine. It has its place in the handle, but is pierced thanks to Quick Piercing only by a light punch on the handle bottom. This makes your Home Defense Revolver 50 quick to use and guarantees full capsules whenever you need them.
        You can easily load six balls in .50 caliber into the drum magazine and defend an attacker with up to 11 joules. Both rubber balls (rubber bullets) and training balls (markers) as well as pepper balls in .50 caliber for self-defense can be fired.
        Also, the appearance of the HDR T4E revolver impressed: The all-metal construction acts alone by their wide revolver shape and the size of deterrent to any attacker. Structured gripping surfaces provide a firm hold even in stress situations and the trigger-pull safety device prevents unwanted loosening in the event of a fall.
        Delivered is the Home Defense Revolver T4E HDR .50 incl. Emergency magazine.</p>
