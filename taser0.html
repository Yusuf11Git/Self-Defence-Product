        <p>TASER X2 is a revolution for shooting stun guns with two cartridges that can be controlled independently for police standards. The new dual laser sight and LED flashlight accurately displays where each probe in a cartridge will be launched - removing any guesswork from firing. The TASERÂ® X2 contains a Central Information Display (CID) that communicates with its user of its power level, cartridge type and status, and will self-diagnosis itself to alert you if any problems arise. A warning electrical arc can be displayed while cartridges are loaded to deter culprits from escalating a conflict, and when probes are launched the Pulse Calibration System delivers the precise amount of electrical charge needed for incapacitation by recalibrating almost 20 times every second to self-adjust. This ensures the full amount of electricity is connecting with the assailant and not being interrupted by clothing, which can reduce its effectiveness. This new technology is 40% safer than previous conducted electronic weapon technology. The Performance Power Magazine (PPM) also provides improved power consumption and can allow up to 500 firings and the IPX2 weather resistance design adds the finishing touches to the X2, allowing it to have the highest performance than any other previous design.</p>
